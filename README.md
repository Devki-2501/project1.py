# Python Project
🪨 Rock–Paper–Scissors Game (Python)
📌 Project Overview

This is a beginner-friendly Rock–Paper–Scissors game built using Python.
The project allows a user to play against the computer through the terminal, where the computer randomly selects its choice and the program determines the result based on simple logic.

An additional feature of this project is text-to-speech output, which announces the choices and the final result, making the game more interactive and engaging.

This project was created as my first Python project to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts.

🎯 Features

User vs Computer gameplay

Random computer choice generation

Win / Lose / Draw result evaluation

Text-to-speech output using pyttsx4

Simple and easy-to-understand logic

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

random module

pyttsx4 (Text-to-Speech)

▶️ How the Game Works

The user enters their choice:

r for Rock

p for Paper

s for Scissors

The computer randomly selects one option.

The program compares both choices using conditional logic.

The result (Win / Lose / Draw) is:

Displayed on the screen

Announced using voice output

🚀 How to Run the Project

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Install the required library:

pip install pyttsx4


Clone the repository or download the code.

Run the Python file:

python rock_paper_scissors.py
